 ## Python Flask Expert Assistant

### Problem Analysis
The problem at hand is to build a YouTube news feed using Python Flask. This involves fetching news articles related to YouTube, displaying them in a user-friendly manner, and providing a way for users to interact with the news.

### Flask Application Design
To solve this problem, we will design a Flask application with the following structure:

#### HTML Files
- `index.html`: This will be the main page of our application, displaying the news articles.
- `article.html`: This template will be used to display individual news articles.

#### Routes
- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` template and display the news articles.
- `/article/<article_id>`: This route will render the `article.html` template and display the specified news article.

### HTML Files
#### index.html
This file will contain the following elements:

- A header section with a title and a navigation bar.
- A main section that will display the news articles. Each article will include a title, a brief description, and a link to the full article.
- A footer section with copyright information.

#### article.html
This file will contain the following elements:

- A header section with the title of the news article.
- A main section that will display the full content of the news article.
- A footer section with a link back to the main page.

### Routes
#### /
This route will handle requests to the main page of our application. It will do the following:

- Fetch news articles related to YouTube from a news API.
- Render the `index.html` template and pass the news articles as a variable.

#### /article/<article_id>
This route will handle requests to view a specific news article. It will do the following:

- Fetch the specified news article from the news API.
- Render the `article.html` template and pass the news article as a variable.

### Conclusion
This design provides a basic structure for a Flask application that can be used to build a YouTube news feed. The application can be further enhanced by adding additional features such as user authentication, user comments, and social sharing.
